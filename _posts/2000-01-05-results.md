## Standardization of data
{: .text-green}
We show that doing the standardization of data as pre-processing, instead of scaling, is better for preserve the spectral information between the input and output images. In Figure below, the ouput Super-resolution image tend to resemble the distribution of the input (Sentinel-2) by using the standardization or follow the target distribution (WorldView) by using the normalization schemes.

## Metrics results on Test Sets
{: .text-green}

We have made two test sets, WS-Set1 is the test sub-set of tiles belonging to the training dataset. WS-Set2 did not belong to the train images, were only used for testing purposes.

<img title="WS-Set2" src="./assets/metrics/results_set2.png" alt="Set2" style="width: 350;"/>

We also have trained other models for Super-resolution and compared the results obtained, showingh that the best results were obtained with our proposed model.
