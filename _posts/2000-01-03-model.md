Our proposed architecture is based on ESRGAN, which is a Generative adversarial Network for Super-resolution. We remove the upsampling modules from the original implementation since we worked with co-registered images, which must be at the same spatial resolution to be co-registered and we modified the input/output channels to work with the four channels available in both remote sensing images, the traditional RGB besides the Near InfraRed (NIR) band.
